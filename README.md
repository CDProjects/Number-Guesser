# Number-Guesser

A really fun Codecademy Challenge regarding functions, which if I am honest, is not my strongest suit in Javascript. THough after a bit of research
and following the hints given in the Challenge, I believe I've completed the task as best as I could. Feel free to leave a comment on how I can 
improve and/or correct my code. Thank you for your time!
